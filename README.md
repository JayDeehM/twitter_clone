# Twitter clone

This is an attempt on making a twitter clone with the use of scaffolding with ruby on rails. 

# Features/Functions

Overall, the app is just basic with the most basic functions of tweeter.

However during the process, there were some issues that occured that made the development quite confusing. Because of this, I just decided to restart all over. The better version is in this link; https://github.com/JayDeehM/twitter_clone_newerest 

Please feel free to check out the better version. And if you would want to fix the problem in this repo, feel free to do so and just send a pull request. Thanks!
